It demonstrates our firm commitment to reducing our environmental impact despite the challenging conditions that we face as a business.<br><br>“Continuing to maintain the Carbon Trust Standard provides a solid platform on which we can develop our environmental programme and build on our efforts over the coming year.”<br><br>NI initially achieved the Carbon Trust Standard in 2010 after demonstrating that our carbon footprint had fallen for three consecutive years.  Each certification period lasts for two years and to maintain certification, NI needed to demonstrate that we have continued to reduce our carbon footprint year-on-year since being originally certified.<br><br>However, the recertification process is made more challenging as the scope of the assessment is widened to include other emissions – most significantly transport from staff travel and company vehicles.<br><br>Achieving recertification is testament to the ongoing efforts of staff from across the business to reduce the company’s environmental footprint.  Through a combination of behavioural change among colleagues and investment in energy-efficient manufacturing equipment at our Newsprinters sites, we reduced our electricity consumption by approximately 13,475,000kWh between 2010 and 2012.<br><br>This is the equivalent of powering 2,450 three-bed homes for a year or keeping the Wembley Stadium arch lit for 16,818 days.<br><br>When considering all of NI’s emissions from electricity, gas and other sources, the audit showed that we have reduced our total carbon footprint by 10.4 per cent since 2010.  This has saved almost 10,500 tonnes of CO2 emissions. <br><br>To put that achievement in perspective, NI’s CO2 savings over the last two years equal 3,400 return flights for one person from London to Sydney.<br><br>As we seek to grow our business, the challenge will be to continue identifying and delivering initiatives that will further reduce our carbon footprint and environmental impact.<br><br>Reducing carbon emissions goes hand-in-hand with improving the efficiency of our business and reducing operational costs.  <br><br>If you have any questions regarding certification or want to get involved in our action on climate change, e-mail NI energy and environment manager Lugano Kapembwa on lugano.kapembwa@newsint.co.uk<br>",

I have worked across print and digital in my career, and luckily started out when there were just beginning to be good opportunities for young journalists in digital.<br><br><strong>What do you enjoy most about being a journalist?</strong><br>I’m sure everyone will say the diversity but its true, no one day is ever the same. I also love the fact you get to meet so many interesting people, whether they are celebrities or not, they all have a fascinating story to tell. Usually the people who want to be journalists are the type of people who are confident talking to strangers and enjoy the art of conversation.<br><br><strong>Best scoop?</strong><br>I&#39;ve worked on so many great stories over my time at The Sunday Times, one lasting memory is flying to Copenhagen to interview John Cleese and film part of his last tour long before it opened in Britain. The video footage was syndicated many times over. I was also lucky enough to get a tour of Disney&#39;s incredible archives in Los Angeles. We persuaded them to allow us to do our own filming inside which was a first. I&#39;m also proud of the story I&#39;m working on at the moment for The Sunday Times Magazine.<br><br><strong>What do you think will be the big social media trends of 2013?</strong><br>Instagram was the big tech story of last year and it&#39;s still evolving. Twitter has just launched a new app called Vine which allows users to embed six seconds of video in Tweets. It&#39;s obviously a tiny amount of footage but it&#39;s already created a lot of buzz and it fits well within Twitter&#39;s micro-blogging ethos.<br><br><strong>How has social media changed journalism?</strong><br>Journalists are more accountable and accessible to their readers especially as a result of sites such as Twitter, which is a huge change with both positive and negative impacts. Readers are now used to sharing content across social networks and having lively and informed discussions with friends around the world. Journalists also use social networks as a source of information, although we are still aware of the need to fact check anything we find on there. It&#39;s hard to summarise as I think we are still seeing the impact on journalism around the globe.<br><br><strong>What’s been your favourite story of 2013 so far?</strong><br>I’m paying close attention to the Europe debate, but the big serious story at the moment is the Algeria hostage situation, which shows how the focus on terrorism is shifting to North Africa. It’s ironic that this terrible crisis is going on the same week that the film Zero Dark Thirty, which chronicles the decade long hunt for Osama Bin Laden and the fight against terrorism in the Middle East, is hitting the cinemas. I think that is definitely the story to watch at the moment<br><br><br><em>Tuesday, February 19, 2013</em><br><br>",

    "Article Body":"<em>From Ben Webster, Media Editor, The Times, in today&#39;s edition (Wednesday, May 1, 2013)<br></em><br><img alt=\"User-added image\" src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44240971/Salesforce%20Images/April%20&#39;13%20-%20May%20&#39;13/20130501_Papers_inside.jpg\"></img><br><br><strong>Politicians should not be given the final say on any changes to a new system of press regulation, according to an opinion poll commissioned by the newspaper industry. Most people also believe there should be a consultation on the proposed Royal Charter on press regulation before it is submitted to the Queen for her signature.<br><br></strong>A group of newspaper publishers last week rejected a charter endorsed by the three main parties and the Hacked Off campaign. The publishers, which include News International, owner of The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun, and four other national newspaper groups, have produced a rival charter that they say has important differences to protect the freedom of the press.<br><br>The poll, commissioned by the Free Speech Network, which is led by newspaper publishers, found that 67 per cent said the new system of press regulation should be set up “in a way that does not give politicians the final say if and when changes need to be made”.<br><br>Under the politicians’ charter, changes could be made only if supported by two-thirds majorities in both Houses of Parliament. The publishers’ version would not give politicians any say and would require changes to be approved unanimously by industry trade associations, the board of a new regulator and a separate “recognition panel”.<br><br>Three quarters of adults (76 per cent) said there should be a consultation on the charter to allow the public their say, as the publishers propose for their version. Only 12 per cent said there was no need for a consultation if a charter had been approved by politicians.<br><br>The Government has resisted calls to have a public consultation on the draft charter it published on March 18, hours after it was approved by the three main parties in the presence of four Hacked Off representatives in the office of Ed Miliband, Labour’s leader.<br><br>The poll, for which Survation questioned 1,000 adults, also found that a small majority (53 per cent) was willing to wait up to a year for a new system of press regulation to be introduced. The overwhelming majority did want a new system of regulation.<br><br>The politicians’ charter is also being challenged by the Chartered Institute of Journalists, which has written to the Privy Council expressing concern that it could conflict with its charter granted by Queen Victoria in 1890.<br><br>Charlie Harris, president of the institute, which has 1,700 members, said: “We have legal advice that the [Government’s] charter ... has serious implications for our own charter.”<br><br>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said that it had not yet submitted the politicians’ charter to the Privy Council. It is unclear whether the Government will proceed with its plan to ask the Queen to sign it at the Privy Council meeting scheduled for May 15.<br><br>Several senior Conservatives, including Peter Lilley, have called for a delay to allow the publishers’ version to be considered.<br><br>In its guidelines on applying for Royal Charters, the Privy Council says: “Any proposal which is rendered controversial by a counter-petition is unlikely to succeed.”<br><br><em><br>Wednesday, May 1, 2013</em><br><br> <br>",

The sound quality and view was great.”<br><br>Claire commented: “Winning the tickets to see The Rolling Stones came as a huge surprise.<br><br>“The whole experience from start to finish – the cable car to the O2, the box, the show – was breathtaking.<br><br>“My friend and I were treated like VIPs in the News International suite – delicious food, perfect seats – and it was great to meet and chat to the other winners.<br><br>“The band pulled out all the stops for the show. I now understand all the hype about Mick Jagger’s moves. I can’t believe the man is almost 70.<br><br>“It was the experience of a lifetime and one I’ll never forget.”<br><br>John remarked: “To be one of the winners of this award was truly unexpected. Even now, after the gig, I can’t quite believe that I was chosen or that my colleagues nominated me in the first place.<br><br>“The box at the O2 was brilliant, complemented by a steady flow of refreshments and food.<br><br>“Having never seen The Rolling Stones, I felt very privileged to get what is now a very rare chance to do so, and they were brilliant. Any fears that these ageing rockers were past it were put to rest from the very start and they continued to thrill throughout.<br><br>“I just want to say thank you very much to the ABC Awards and to my colleagues for giving me this opportunity to have such a great night watching one of the world’s biggest bands.”<br><br>Danny from Commercial said: “Thank you NI, what an amazing prize. Tickets aside, recognition for my work is fantastic, but the fact that this appreciation materialised in the form of two Stones tickets…unbelievable.<br><br>“The boys have still got it! At the tender age of 23, I doubt even I could ‘move like Jagger’ still can, in fact I fear for the welfare of his joints. So energetic was the performance that I needed a sit down – luckily there was a private suite on hand. I could definitely get used to this.”<br><br>The ABC Awards incorporate Spot Prizes and Money Can’t Buy accolades.<br><br>Spot Prizes are awarded throughout the year by executive directors and editors to recognise exceptional work. These will include Amazon vouchers and tickets to events at the O2 and Wembley.<br><br>Money Can’t Buy quarterly prizes are for nominated colleagues for consistently going the extra mile. These include tickets to film premieres, football/rugby internationals, The Ashes, Wimbledon and other fantastic events.<br><br>Rebecca Heryett, compensation and benefits manager in HR at TMS, won a Spot Prize to see Robbie Williams at the O2.<br><br>She said: “Wow what an evening, a fab night was had by all at the Robbie concert. The show was high-energy with classic singalong tunes intermingled with his new songs to make for a great night.<br><br>“I also got to meet some great people from across the business and would definitely advocate the ABC Awards – thanks NI, it was a top night.”<br><br>Marketing events manager Amy Dawson was also chosen to see Williams.<br><br>She said: “I was extremely excited and grateful when I won the tickets. It was out of the blue and I was very flattered to have been chosen. The fact it was Robbie was ideal as I saw him at Knebworth a few years ago and loved it.<br><br>“The box was brilliant, the people that went were great and we had such a laugh. We had a great view and Robbie is the ultimate entertainer so he was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed my evening and it was a great way to meet people in other areas of NI that I don’t get to interact with in my day-to-day role.”<br>",

When I saw the stand on the level 6 it seemed silly not to take the opportunity to get it sorted (and pick up some free chocolates). </span><br style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">\n<br style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">\n<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">The GAYE team were incredibly helpful in recommending charities and providing information about the work that they do. I never did manage to narrow it down to just one, but instead chose to split my donation between the Red Cross and Water Aid. It was a tough decision, but after chatting to the team about the kind of causes I was interested in supporting, this is what it came down to...</span><br style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">\n<br style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">\n<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">The Red Cross website states their aim help people in crisis, no matter who they are or where they are from. Be it helping families to locate missing relatives after an earthquake, chairing a forum to improve communications between NGOs and the British armed forces during conflict, or providing practical and emotional support to asylum seekers, the Red Cross does a incredibly diverse range of invaluable work both in the UK and overseas. By donating to the charity, I hope that my contribution can help the people who need it most, whether a refugee from Syria or HIV sufferer from London.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">\n<br style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">\n<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">Access to clean, fresh drinking water and good sanitation is an issue that I feel very strongly about, and there are many charities that work tirelessly for this cause. WaterAid work with local partners to develop practical technologies and skills within the communities that they are working with, and also help those communities to influence governments and service providers to prioritise safe water and sanitation. I chose to support WaterAid as I believe that this is a powerful and sustainable approach to the water crisis that will ultimately see wide-reaching and long lasting effects, and I feel privileged to be in a position to support the charity.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">\n<br style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">\n<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: small; \">Having chosen my two charities, the team had everything up and running in minutes. It was all so quick and easy, I would highly recommend the scheme to anyone interested in giving a little something back. If not just for the warm glow, then perhaps for the chance to win a teddy in the prize draw?&quot;<br><br></span><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; \"><u>Missed out on previous contributors?

Her professional career began at Penthouse magazine in 1966. However since then she has written for many different British newspapers and for the American magazine Vanity Fair. She has published two collections of her interviews ‘Mostly Men’ and ‘Demon Barber’. Her memoir, ‘An Education’, was made into a BAFTA-winning film starring Carey Mulligan in 2009. Her next book, ‘My Life in Interviews’, is due out next year. She joined The Sunday Times in 2009.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(52, 52, 52); \"><b style=\"background-color: transparent; \">What do you think was your most important or revealing interview and why?</b></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(52, 52, 52); \">I don’t know if it was ‘important’ but I did a highly controversial interview with the tennis player Rafael Nadal in 2011 which means I have been trolled by Rafa fans ever since! I didn’t find him as charming as everyone told me I would. But I took the opportunity to point out that sports stars are now so tightly controlled by PRs we really have no idea of their true characters.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(52, 52, 52); \">An interview that has returned to haunt me is one I did with Sir Jimmy Savile in 1990. It caused great scandal at the time because he had just been knighted and he was showing me all the telegrams of congratulation he’d had from members of the royal family. And then I told him there was a very widespread rumour that he liked little girls. It obviously didn’t come as news to him, and he had a pat answer, but readers were shocked that I even raised the question. The general assumption was that he would not have been knighted if there were any suspicions about him – we now know of course that that is not true.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(52, 52, 52); \"><b style=\"background-color: transparent; \">What factor has contributed most to your enduring career in journalism?</b></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(52, 52, 52); \">I think what’s kept me going as an interviewer is my enduring nosiness. I have never lost my curiosity about other people or my desire to try to understand their lives.  It probably stems from being an only child and wondering what other families were like. I believe, as I said in my memoir, An Education, that other people are ultimately unknowable – but that’s what makes the pursuit so interesting.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(52, 52, 52); \">I also made a wise decision early on to interview as wide a range of people as possible – everyone from Harriet Harman to Lady Gaga – so that I could not be typecast as either a heavyweight or lightweight interviewer. The only people I don’t like interviewing are very nice, friendly, straightforward people with no hang-ups. I am much happier interviewing people who are rude, difficult, and abrasive – give me a Lord Sugar over a Michael Palin every time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(52, 52, 52); \"><b style=\"background-color: transparent; \">Is there anyone, a major world figure perhaps, you would like to interview and why?</b></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(52, 52, 52); \">I would LOVE to interview Rupert Murdoch! I would also like to interview Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Mick Jagger and/or Keith Richards. I spent years trying to get an interview with the artist Lucian Freud, writing to him about once a month, and was eventually rewarded with a hand-written note saying he did not wish ‘to be shat on by a stranger’ – I now have it framed in my loo. But I never got an interview.</p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(52, 52, 52); \"><b style=\"background-color: transparent; \">What does winning Interviewer of the Year at the press awards mean to you?</b></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(52, 52, 52); \">I was thrilled to win my sixth Press Award this year, having won my first in 1986 – I can now boast that I’ve been winning Press Awards for four decades! What’s great about the Press Awards is that they’re given by journalists to journalists so they really are the Oscars of our profession.<br><br><br><br><em>Wednesday, May 8, 2013</em><br> </p>",

    "Article Body":"<em>Tuesday, April 30, 2013<br></em><br><br>Dear Colleagues,<br><br><strong>We now have the results of the Your Opinion survey that was completed in February.  An impressive 88% of you took the time to tell the executive team and me how you feel about working at News International.  Thank you.</strong><br><br>When we launched the survey, we made a commitment to listen to what you are saying and act on the key areas you highlight.  We also promised to share the results with everyone around the business.<br><br>For the first time ever, we have made the results of the survey available for every member of staff – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/newsint.co.uk/file/d/0BxuoRMKqK1RCak5CN2ZiWldOSVk/edit\">please click here</a>.  We have already shared the results with senior managers across the business and they will be speaking with you about the results and what they mean for your department in the coming weeks.<br><br><strong>Derrick Crowley</strong>, <strong>NI’s Group HR Director</strong>, will be hosting a webchat at <strong>1:30pm</strong> on <strong>Thursday</strong>, <strong>May 2</strong>, to take you through the results and answer your questions. More details on this will follow shortly.<br><br>For me, the strongest message that has come out of the survey is the appetite for a clear strategy and sense of direction for NI.  This is not a surprise and has been my priority for the past three and a half months. I have been working closely with the executive team and we are a few weeks away from starting to set out in detail what the ‘NI story’ will mean for all of us.<br><br>The survey reveals a strong belief in the world-class quality of our content and your pride in our products.  It also tells us that many of you are feeling less confident and optimistic about the future.  This is understandable given the very difficult period the company has been through and is further evidence of the need for a coherent and straightforward vision.<br><br>It is clear that we need to get better at linking our future to yours. Some areas of the business are much better than others at helping people to plan their careers and get access to training and development; we want to make sure this is consistently accessible in every department.  There is also a demand for increased communication and we will be building on recent improvements to ensure you are kept informed of the company’s direction.<br><br>Our day-to-day operation is working well in many areas.  People understand their roles and how they are contributing to the success of their department and the company.  There is a great affinity within teams and a high level of support between colleagues, for which I am very grateful.  Successful teamwork and collaboration are an essential part of our success, both now and in the future.<br><br>These are some initial thoughts and I welcome your input as you discuss these results in teams over the coming weeks.  Please do take the time to watch the webchat with Derrick on Thursday where he will be covering the survey in more detail and answering your questions.<br><br>Warm regards,<br><br><img width=\"162\" height=\"97\" alt=\"User-added image\" src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44240971/MikeSignature.jpg\"></img><br>",

The standard of nominations was yet again extremely high and we are delighted to announce the following winners:</strong><br><br><strong>Scott McCulloch – Commercial, Glasgow</strong><br>Scott was nominated for always going above and beyond in his work as a Community Champion. He was praised for using his network, creativity and knowledge of NI to make things happen for our charity partners in the Scottish Office. Not only did he create a competition for Trees for Cities that ran in the Scottish Sun but also encouraged his editorial colleagues to get involved with the Prince’s Trust ‘Get into Media’ programme.  Scott was singled out for putting Glasgow on the map in terms of community engagement on top of his day job as a Business Development Manager in Commercial.<br><strong><br>Robert Stevenson – Commercial, London</strong><br>Robert, an advertising support professional, was nominated for devising a solution that went above and beyond in engineering a better way to manage “Lookaheads”, a key stage in the selling, planning and processing of inserts in our magazines. Robert has created an automated lookahead builder that is now used to plan inserts for The Sun and will save the department 130 working hours over the course of a year, reducing our cost to serve as well as reducing the risk of input errors. He was highly praised for his approach to the project and showed himself to be a tenacious collaborative self-starter, going above and beyond the scope of his day-to-day role.<br><strong><br>Niamh McCormack – HR, Dublin</strong><br>Niamh was nominated by a number of colleagues from different departments in our Dublin office. She was described as one of NI’s best assets for the exceptional support she gives to staff during stressful and challenging situations. To our colleagues in Ireland she is seen as a standalone ‘human intranet’ for all queries or complaints, and regularly takes time to cover tasks that no one wants to do even if out of her daily remit e.g. assisting marketing with the packaging of promotional goods, covering reception, taking delivery of technology equipment and even organising the toilets to be cleaned. Niamh was singled out for being the person who makes NI a happier and less chaotic place to work in.<br><br>Niamh has won a pair of ‘money can’t buy’ Première tickets to see the new Die Hard film, ‘A Good Day to Die Hard’, courtesy of our friends at Fox on February 7, Robert has won tickets for his friends and families to share the NI box in Wembley for the Capital One Cup Final and Scott has won a sightseeing trip to London for his family.<br><br>Nominations for the 2nd quarterly prize will open soon.  Keep an eye out on the &#39;Your ABC Awards&#39; section of the Intranet for more details.<br><br><strong>Don&#39;t forget you can nominate a colleague at any time by simply <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/newsint.co.uk/abc-awards/?pli=1\">clicking on this link</a> or the &#39;ABC Awards&#39; app on the homepage.<br></strong><br><br><em>Monday, January 28, 2013</em><br><br>",

    "Article Body":"<em>Thursday, May 9, 2013</em><br><br><br>Dear Colleagues,<br><br>Overnight in New York, News Corporation announced its third quarter earnings for FY13.  Overall the company recorded healthy financial results for Q3 FY13, with year on year revenue for the quarter up 14% to $9.54 billion and adjusted operating income up 4% to $1.43 billion. <br><br>Regarding the publishing part of the business, News Corporation reported quarterly segment operating income of $85 million, a $45 million decrease from the $130 million reported in the same period a year ago.  Within these results, the UK newspapers’ contribution increased, benefiting from the launch of the Sunday edition of The Sun in February 2012.  This was more than offset by lower advertising revenues at the Australian newspapers and integrated marketing services businesses.  Amplify, the Company’s education business, continued its investment phase working towards the aim of transforming the education market, considered as the last business to be touched by the digital revolution.<br><br>Commenting on the results, Rupert Murdoch said:<br><br>“We are on target to complete the proposed separation of our businesses near the end of our fiscal year.  As we prepare to launch two new industry leaders with new News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, I am more confident than ever of the long-term value the separation will unlock for the Company and its shareholders.”  <br><br>At NI we will be starting out life in the new business in a fantastic position, able to draw on a rich heritage, a strong stable of brands and cutting edge technology – helping us continue to deliver our distinctive editorial content and build a profitable future.<br> <br>There will be more details communicated around the formation of the new company in the coming weeks, and we will also be sharing with you the comprehensive vision and strategy for NI that has been my priority since I joined in January. <br><br>Please <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/newsint.co.uk/file/d/0BxuoRMKqK1RCOC1TbEVHcGxZNkU/edit?usp=sharing\">click here</a> to see the full News Corp earnings release.<br><br>Warm regards,<br><br><img style=\"width: 108px; height: 75px; \" alt=\"User-added image\" src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44240971/MikeSignature.jpg\"></img><br>",

It’s exciting that people who would not normally consider this a career option now have the chance to go for it.”<br><br>Sportsbeat editor David Parsons said: “Our aim is to teach and inspire the reporting stars of tomorrow and for four straight years our trainees have made our sister company, News Associates, the number one ranked NCTJ journalism school in London.<br><br>“We are also excited at having a driven and ambitious young reporter supplementing our agency&#39;s work throughout their nine months studying on our training scheme. There will certainly be plenty of opportunities to work at sporting venues across the country and assist our journalists reporting on the build-up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games.”<br><br>The course includes modules in news reporting and sports journalism, video journalism and shorthand, as well as sports PR, media law and public affairs. Four days a week will be spent at a training centre in South-West London and there will be an opportunity to contribute to Sportsbeat’s network of football and rugby union reporting. <br><br>Bob Satchwell, Executive Director of the Society of Editors, said:  “Any scheme that opens the doors to a career in journalism to those who might normally be priced out of a college place is very good news.<br><br>“This is a great opportunity for somebody to embark on a career and I congratulate The Sun and Sportsbeat for the initiative that complements the important work of the Journalism Diversity Fund that is administered on behalf of the media by the NCTJ.”<br><br>Joanne Butcher, Chief Executive of the National Council for the Training of Journalists, said: “This scholarship is a wonderful idea which will give someone an opportunity to break into the exciting world of sports journalism while experiencing at first-hand how the sports desk of a national newspaper works.<br> <br>“I welcome the initiative by The Sun and Sportsbeat to help widen the diversity of journalism trainees.”<br><br>The application process opens on February 1, 2013 with a deadline of April 30, 2013.

The title replaced Sunday magazine as News of the World&#39;s women&#39;s magazine and has since been housed by three different newspapers, most recently in The Sun on Sundays.<br><br>In five years Fabulous has lured a raft of A-list names onto it&#39;s iconic covers. Lady Gaga, Simon Cowell, J-Lo, One Direction and Cheryl Cole have all graced page one and helped Fabulous become Britain&#39;s most-read women&#39;s glossy magazine.<br><br>The title has won numerous awards, with its editor Rachel Richardson being named Editor of the Year (Newspaper and Current Affairs Magazines) at the 2012 BSME awards, whilst Assistant Editor (Celebrity) Beth Neil won Interviewer of the Year at last year&#39;s British Press Awards.<br><br>Editor, Rachel Richardson said: &quot;Fabulous has enjoyed huge success over the last five years and I&#39;m thrilled we have reached this milestone and remain the market leader.<br><br>&quot;Given the closure of News of the World, it is even more amazing that we are able to celebrate our anniversary in The Sun.<br><br>&quot;My team and I have exciting plans to develop the brand and evolve the magazine in 2013, so we are hoping our sixth year is as successful as the last five.&quot;<br><br><br><br><strong>A Fabulous journey</strong><br><br>Amid a blaze of publicity, Fabulous magazine began life as the News of the World mag on February 3, 2008.  Following the closure of the NotW in July 2011, Fabulous switched to the Saturday edition of sister title The Sun. When the Sunday edition of the Sun was launched a year ago, Fabulous became part of that new era.<br>An eventful five-year journey, but the magazine has gone from strength to strength. Here, Fabulous editor Rachel Richardson (pictured above) answers our questions about the magazine.<br><br><br><strong>How has Fabulous overcome the challenges of changing title and publication day?</strong><br>The closure of News of the World was very tough for my team. Not only did the Fabulous staff believe they had lost their jobs for a few hours, they watched all of their colleagues lose theirs. It was a very sad time. Thankfully for the Fabulous team the decision was taken to re-home the magazine on Saturday&#39;s in The Sun. I think the magazine has flourished under The Sun and being back on a Sunday feels right as we are an indulgent and inspirational read. Saturday&#39;s were fun, but Sunday&#39;s are where we belong. <br><br><br><strong>What are the key areas that Fabulous has developed in over the past five years?</strong><br>The overall package has become much slicker as we have found our feet and confidence. We have launched and succeed in producing great campaigns and talked-about features. Visually it is a much more appealing magazine than it was for its first issues. I am really proud of our success in making Fabulous a brand in its own right, which has spawned successful extensions like Fabulous Bingo, the Fabulous Fashion Awards and the Fabulous Beauty Awards. We have also made huge strides digitally. The Fabulousmag.co.uk site, which was relaunched last May, has it&#39;s own identity and is growing in terms of unique users and page views each month.<br>The magazine has won numerous awards. That must be tribute to a talented staff.<br><br>Fabulous has been given various honours at BSME and the British Press Awards and I feel they have been in recognition of my hugely talented team. I am very lucky to have great strength in depth, so from my fashion team to the subs desk they are all at the top of their game. I have a great leadership team and an outstanding Creative Director in Mark Hayman. Assistant Editor (Celebrity) Beth Neil is an exceptional journalist who procures and writes up to 53 cover stories a year. No one else in the business has that pressure. And the picture team deserve a mention for their brilliant work making our covers so iconic week in week out.  <br><br><br><strong>How important is developing the Fabulous digital presence?</strong><br>It is hugely important to us to have a Fabulous digital presence. Producing the best possible Fabulous is often restricted by our pagination and regularity. Digitally we are free of those chains and can deliver Fabulous to audiences beyond readers of The Sun.<br><br><br><strong>You must be delighted at the calibre of star interviews/photo-shoots Fabulous has managed to attract.</strong><br>Fabulous has been able to attract world famous celebrities with ease because we can provide celebrities with a huge audience and we always shoot them in a creative way.  In a highly competitive market we are often selected to get the exclusive, from Justin Bieber&#39;s only UK interview to promote his album, to One Direction&#39;s first interview in 9 months, we are able to bring our readers the hot star that week. I&#39;m particularly proud that we interviewed and shot Lady Gaga exclusively for the magazine, that we can get access to Jennifer Lopez and that the Kardashians will shoot for us.  We are also able to attract world-class photographers to shoot for us. Not many tabloid supplements can boast about that.<br><br><strong>What is your favourite front cover?<br></strong>I think on reflection Lady Gaga was a real coup. Most recently I adore our six-cover special with One Direction, while our beauty special with Katherine Jenkins was a exceptional. I&#39;m a huge fan of our Tom Daly one too. The team had just an 1 hour to shoot a cover and inside pictures, yet produced a stunning set of images that Tom himself picked for his official calendar.<br><br><br><strong>What of the future for Fabulous?</strong><br>Fabulous has a very exciting future. We have just undertaken some extensive reader research and new plans will be born out of that. We are also hoping to develop the male-female double issue concept which we trialled in November. One half of the magazine was Fabulous content and the other MF content (Men&#39;s Fabulous) Expect to see a few more of them in 2013, as well as some exciting digital developments.<br><br><br><em>Monday, February 4, 2013</em><br><br><br><br><img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44240971/Salesforce%20Images/February%20&#39;13%20-%20March%20&#39;13/EmmaWillis.jpg\" alt=\"User-added image\"></img><br><br><img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44240971/Salesforce%20Images/February%20&#39;13%20-%20March%20&#39;13/CherylCole.jpg\" alt=\"User-added image\"></img><br><br><img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44240971/Salesforce%20Images/February%20&#39;13%20-%20March%20&#39;13/Gaga.jpg\" alt=\"User-added image\"></img><br><br><img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44240971/Salesforce%20Images/February%20&#39;13%20-%20March%20&#39;13/jlo.jpg\" alt=\"User-added image\"></img><br><br><img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44240971/Salesforce%20Images/February%20&#39;13%20-%20March%20&#39;13/KellyOsbourne.jpg\" alt=\"User-added image\"></img><br><br><img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44240971/Salesforce%20Images/February%20&#39;13%20-%20March%20&#39;13/OneDirection.jpg\" alt=\"User-added image\"></img><br><br><img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44240971/Salesforce%20Images/February%20&#39;13%20-%20March%20&#39;13/Simon%26Amanda.jpg\" alt=\"User-added image\"></img><br><br>",

The former BSkyB chief operating officer took over at the start of the year and began introductory visits around the business with talks in The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times’ newsrooms on January 8.<br><br><br><strong>What’s your ambition at NI?<br></strong>I will work hard to be the CEO the company deserves, bringing out the best in our people and putting the business on a sound footing for the future.<br><br><strong>Does that mean making money?<br></strong>In large part, yes. Every area of this business should be sustainably profitable in the future. I don’t want us to be subsidised by the Americans or Australians, and I don’t want us to be the sick child of the new company we’ll become part of this summer.<br><br><strong>How will you achieve that?</strong><br>I want to invest in our journalism, and focus very sharply on our readers. Putting the customer first is key. We need to lock in more of our readers through subscriptions, and ensure that when we do they are getting value – and stick with us.<br><strong><br>Will you stick with the paywall?</strong><br>Absolutely. I don’t like the name, but I believe in the principle. I’d call it “news worth paying for”. We charge for our content because we spend good money on it. You can’t invest in quality journalism and give it away.<br><br><strong>But others do?</strong><br>Yes, and I know from my previous role how hard it is to compete with a free rival, and see off the parasites who profit from simply re-packaging material some of us spent good money producing.<br><br><strong>What is your plan for the papers?<br></strong>I have no intention of breathing down editorial necks. We have first-class journalists on all our titles.  My role is to run the business, not edit those titles.<br><br><strong>Is there a future for print?</strong><br>There certainly is. News is a basic human necessity. We should provide it any time, any place and on the full range of available platforms. Print is one of those platforms, and will co-exist alongside digital for some time yet.<br><br><strong>How can we park the past?</strong><br>We have to acknowledge the past, but then focus on the future. And then ensure that our pride in our papers is matched by a pride in how we go about our business. We all need to do the training on offer, but this is ultimately about culture not just rules.  Imagine if we were profiled on the Ten O’Clock News. I’d like to ensure we could stand up to that scrutiny in our stride.<br><br> <br><br><strong>MIKE DARCEY PROFILE</strong><br><br><strong>Born</strong>: June 10, 1965<br><br><strong>Age</strong>: 47<br><br><strong>Family</strong>: Wife Julie, son Jonathan (16) and daughter Laura (14)<br><br><strong>Lives at</strong>: Teddington in West London<br><br><strong>Supports</strong>: Chelsea at football (his children were born at Chelsea Hospital so he has inherited this from his kids) and The All Blacks at rugby<br><br><strong>Favourite food</strong>: Anything from south-east Asia, loves spicy food<br><br><strong>Music</strong>: ‘Dad rock’ from Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, to more modern bands like Kings of Leon, The Vaccines, The Script, Band of Skulls<br><br><strong>Book</strong>: Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel<br><br><strong>TV show</strong>: Homeland<br><br><strong>Places</strong>: Beaches and mountains. He particularly likes Woolacombe Bay in Devon; surfing at Whitesands Bay in Pembrokeshire and walking in the Lake District. Also, anywhere where there is lots of snow and a steep slope<br><br><strong>Charities</strong>: Contact the Elderly in Teddington (his family hosts an annual tea party for them) and Bristol renal unit (where they saved his brother-in-law’s life)<br><br><strong>Saying</strong>: ‘What is going on inside their head?’ At home and at work, think about the underlying causes of anyone’s behaviour<br><br><strong>Interests</strong>: Loves to ski, also surfing, cycling and running. He was a national gymnastics champion in New Zealand as a teenager.<br><br><br> ",

    "Article Body":"<em>Wednesday, February 7, 2013</em><br><br><br>Dear Colleagues,<br><br>Yesterday evening News Corporation announced its second quarter earnings for FY13.  Overall the company recorded healthy financial results for Q2 FY13, with revenue up 5% to $9.43 billion and adjusted operating income up 5% to $1.66 billion. <br><br>As regards our part of the business, News Corporation highlighted overall improvement in the publishing sector, with “increased contributions from the U.K. newspapers which benefited from the launch of the Sunday edition of The Sun in February 2012.”<br><br>Commenting on the results, Rupert Murdoch said:<br><br><br>&quot;News Corporation’s fiscal second quarter performance reflects our strong momentum. Double-digit gains in our Cable and Television businesses, along with improvements in our Publishing segment, drove revenue and earnings growth even as we seized opportunities to invest in our core businesses for long- term and sustainable growth.<br><br>“The strategies we executed against in the quarter continue to bolster News Corporation&#39;s competitive position and enhance our ability to benefit from global demand for content, especially sports programming. As we make progress toward the proposed separation of our entertainment and publishing businesses later this year, I am confident in the future prospects for both businesses.”<br><br><br>With the UK 4th Quarter GDP at -0.3%, it is clear that we are still negotiating a fragile economic environment.  Regardless of whether or not we can escape a triple dip recession next quarter, it is reasonable for the country to expect a muted recovery for some time.<br><br>Despite this challenging context, you will have seen from our successful acquisition of the Barclays Premier League internet and mobile clips rights that we are not afraid to invest in areas that most directly support our world-class journalism and that can transform the experience we offer our subscribers.<br><br>We have an exciting few months ahead with the upcoming business split in the summer and the formation of the proposed new News Corporation.  There will doubtless be challenges to overcome and opportunities for us to seize, and I welcome your input as we work together to secure the long-term success of our titles.<br><br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/newsint.co.uk/file/d/0BxuoRMKqK1RCaUw4V1k5TVM5R2M/edit?usp=sharing\">Click here</a> to access the full News Corp earnings release.<br><br>Warm regards,<br><br><img width=\"115\" height=\"69\" src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44240971/MikeSignature.jpg\" alt=\"User-added image\"></img> <strong><br><br><br></strong>",

Their two main ways of achieving this are promoting awareness and opposing specific abuses of human rights i.e. wrongful imprisonment.<br><br>Centrepoint is a UK based charitable organisation focusing on supporting and rehabilitating homeless young people by offering housing, support and access to education; this is with a view to making sure that these young people have a future.<br><br>I chose these two charities because I feel strongly that people should have opportunities to succeed in life and be independent, regardless of their background and associated challenges; which much of the time are outside of their control.  Also, since joining NI I have become particularly inspired by and identify closely with the widely shared belief that social injustice should not go unreported or unchallenged and that we should all seek to protect those who are vulnerable to this for whatever reason.&quot;<strong><br><u><br>Missed out on previous contributors?
